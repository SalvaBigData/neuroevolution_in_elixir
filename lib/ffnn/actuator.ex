  The actuator process gathers the control signals from the neurons, appending
  them to the accumulator. The order in which the signals are accumulated into
  a vector is in the same order as the neuron ids are stored within NIds. Once
  all the signals have been gathered, the actuator sends cortex the sync signal,
  executes its function, and then again begins to wait for the neural signals
  from the output layer by reseting the fanin_pids from the second copy of the
  list.
